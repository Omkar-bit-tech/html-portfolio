<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Omkar Ashutosh Kabat from Bhubaneswar, Odisha. I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor of
   Technology in Computer Science and Engineering, with a passion for full-stack web development.</p>

<p>As an aspiring Full-Stack Web Developer, I've built over 16 projects through comprehensive 
   courses, gaining hands-on experience in both frontend and backend technologies. I enjoy creating
   scalable and efficient web applications using modern tools like React, Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, 
   and even exploring Web3 development.</p>

<p>My skill set includes frontend development with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6), React.js, and backend
   expertise in Node.js and Express.js. I'm also proficient with databases like PostgreSQL and MongoDB, 
   and familiar with authentication methods such as JWT and OAuth. Additionally, I deploy applications 
   using platforms like GitHub Pages, Netlify, and Vercel.</p>

<p>Some of my favorite projects include building a responsive personal portfolio website, a full-stack 
   blog with user authentication, a React-based weather app, and a Web3 NFT minting decentralized 
   application.</p>

<p>I'm eager to contribute to exciting projects and grow as a developer, whether through junior 
   developer roles or freelance opportunities. Outside of coding, I enjoy learning new technologies 
   and pushing the boundaries of what web applications can do.</p>
